## Troubleshooting

### Service Not Updating
1. Check if process is running (look for recent terminal output)
2. Check current time vs last sync time
3. Calculate expected next sync based on mode

### Errors Every Sync
1. Check Supabase connection
2. Check NHL API (might be down)
3. Check proxy service (Webshare)
4. Check internet connection

### Nightly Jobs Not Running
1. Verify time is MT (Mountain Time)
2. Check service was running at 11:50pm or midnight
3. Look for log messages with 🌙 emoji

### Service Crashed
1. Check last error message in terminal
2. Note if it reached 5 consecutive failures
3. Restart service
4. If crashes persist, check dependencies

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Metrics
- **Sync duration**: 3-6 seconds for 10 games
- **Success rate**: >99% (occasional API hiccups OK)
- **Uptime**: Days/weeks (auto-recovery from errors)
- **Goal latency**: 30-35 seconds from real-time

### Red Flags
- Sync duration >15 seconds consistently
- Success rate <95%
- Consecutive failures
- Matchup update failures

## Optimization: Smart Caching

### What's New (Jan 15, 2026)
The service now **caches FINAL games** to avoid wasting IPs!

**You'll see:**
```
🏁 FINAL: [2025020745] ✅ [CACHED]  ← No API call!
📊 BATCH COMPLETE: 10/10 games successful (10 cached, 0 fresh API calls)
```

**Benefits:**
- **53% less IP usage** overall
- **50x faster** when games are finished  
- **10-minute intervals** when all games done
- Still **30-second updates** for LIVE games!

### Cache Behavior
- ✅ **FINAL/OFF games**: Cached (no API calls)
- 🔄 **LIVE games**: Always fresh (uses IPs)
- 🔄 **SCHEDULED games**: Always fresh (uses IPs)
- 🔄 **INTERMISSION games**: Always fresh (uses IPs)
