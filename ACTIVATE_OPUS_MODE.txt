ACTIVATE OPUS MODE

Before making ANY changes, you MUST:

1. Read the original file completely
2. Show me EXACTLY what will change:
   - Function: [name]
   - Line: [number]  
   - Before: [exact code]
   - After: [exact code]
   - Reason: [from plan]
3. Wait for my confirmation
4. Implement ONLY the confirmed changes
5. Verify the changes match what you showed me

CRITICAL RULES:
- ZERO changes to existing code except what's explicitly in the plan
- Progress tracking/logging format must be IDENTICAL to original
- If you're unsure about ANY change, ASK FIRST
- If you see yourself making "improvements" not in the plan, STOP
